1.Open the WiFi localisation network server with trained check-point.

2.Change the URL in the Unity Json Fetcher file attached with "start" object to make sure that Unity can send and receive
predicted position data correctly.
(In this script, you can also change the frequency of request. Lower the frequency if you want a more stable navigation effect, increase the frequency if you want a more real-time location.There will be some inaccurate localisation because of the WiFi method systematic error.)

3.Build and Run the completed work at Unity and download it to the mobile phone.

4.Run the Localisation and Navigation App at mobile phone.
